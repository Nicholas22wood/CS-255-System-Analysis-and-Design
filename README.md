# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well?

The DriverPass project is a development of a website and a phone application for student drivers. The website lets student drivers schedule drives, take practice test, and review notes from their previous drives. The client is the Owner of DriverPass and they wanted to have a system that is capable of being used on mobile phone as well as website and they wanted the users to be able to schedule the drives as well as take online test. The owner also wanted to be responsible for the business side of the company and he wanted a cloud based server to be in charge of security and data backup. I believe I documented well and provided enough information for the system so that it can be constructed properly in the development process.

2. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think the one part I would take more time in is developing the class diagram. I had a good starting off point and included a lot of good information but I believe if I had more time to really get into what each class did I could have a program that was laid out very well with all the correct attributes and functions.

3. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The users need are extremely important when developing a program, they will be using the program more than the developers and owner. I would say that the users also give insight into what they will be doing and what features they will use the most. The user’s needs are difficult to interpret at times but it is good to ask many questions and also qualifying questions to verify it is what they want.

4. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The best approach to start the process of designing software is obtain information from the client as well as documenting everything about the software that you believe will be implemented. I would also start by creating diagrams of the system as well and try to get a layout that would be similar to what we plan to implement. After this then I would start developing the system based on an overall layout and start working on the most important features. With a team working on this I think creating a backlog of the user stories would be the next step before actual creating the system.
